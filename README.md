# LogicManager Coding Assessment

The code can be found in two places:
* In this repository
* In this CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/4z11qo950

The application can be viewed at the CodeSandbox link, but it has also been deployed via [Now](https://zeit.co/now) and can be visited at: ~~https://logic-manager-bamwcodxsa.now.sh/~~

https://logic-manager-uqkqenzkak.now.sh *

It is better to use the above [Now](https://zeit.co/now) link to view the finished app, since I did not use a CSS framework and instead relied on vanilla CSS + CSS Modules for styling - the styles are a little off in the CodeSandbox version, which I guess does not support CSS Modules.

\* Changelog: added logic to properly pluralize "FREE BIKE(s)" and "EMPTY SLOT(S)"
